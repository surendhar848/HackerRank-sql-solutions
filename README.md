# HackerRank SQL Solutions 👨‍💻

This repository contains **all** the SQL challenges I’ve solved on HackerRank, organized in the exact order I finished them. Each `.sql` file is a standalone solution to one problem.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Browse** any `.sql` file to see the exact query I submitted.  
2. **Copy & paste** into your own SQL editor or directly into HackerRank to test.  
3. **Learn** by comparing different approaches (especially for advanced problems).

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Basic `SELECT` & filtering  
- `JOIN`s (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)  
- Aggregation (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
